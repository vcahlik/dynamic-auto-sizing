# Dynamic Auto-Sizing

Implementation of the **dynamic auto-sizing technique** together with notebooks from experiments. Created in part under the Student Research Program 2021 of FIT CTU in Prague and in part under my diploma thesis.

## Project structure

* *nets* - Python package with the implementations
* *notebooks* - Jupyter notebooks with experiments
    * *standalone* - Experiments with dynamic auto-sizing
    * *anytime* - Experiments with dynamic auto-sizing as an underlying technique for anytime algorithms
    * *misc* - Supporting code, e.g. for the rendering of figures

## How to run

1. Clone the repository, `cd` into it.
2. Install required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Python version 3.9 is recommended).
3. Open Jupyter Lab using `jupyter lab`.
